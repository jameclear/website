# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "A tri-layered chiral metasurface is proposed and demonstrated to exhibit broadband asymmetric transmission of linearly polarized electromagnetic waves in two opposite directions. The full wave simulation shows that the proposed metasurface can rigorously satisfy the asymmetric transmission (AT) theorem and can achieve cross-polarization conversion with high efficiencies for linearly polarization waves. Moreover, an extra-noticeable advantage of the proposed structure is its broad operation bandwidth in microwave band."
abstract_short = "Due to the Fabry-PÃ©rot-like effect, the cross-polarization conversion can reach a maximum of 0.94 and exceed 0.7 from 10 GHz to 30 GHz, exhibiting a broadband characteristic in microwave spectra. Moreover, our structure is not only extremely thin in the propagating direction but also very small in the transverse directions."
