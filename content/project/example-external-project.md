Using the Metamaterial or metasurface can manipulation electromagnetic properties such as polarization, phase, amplitude and orbital angular momentum and so on. In this field I have proposed and investigated a novel chiral circular polarizer based on ```e-shape structure``` and ```F-P cavity asymmetric transmission structure```. These structures can be used to manipulate the polarization of he EM waves. 

- **e-shape structure**
- **F-P cavity structure**

## e-shape structure
> ###### At two resonant frequencies, i.e., 11.65 GHz and 13.02 GHz, the incident y-direction linearly polarized wave can be transformed into right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves, respectively.

## F-P cavity structure
> ###### This structure can exhibit the broadband asymmetric transmission phenomenon from 10 GHz to 30 GHz. Due to the Fabry-PÃ©rot-like effect, the cross-polarization conversion can reach a maximum of 0.94 and exceed 0.7 from 10 GHz to 30 GHz.
