___________________________________________________
Inspired by the theoretical deduction of the ```E. F. Kuester```, ```C. L. Holloway``` and ```S. A. Tretyakov```, and so many different excellent works like the ```C. Pfeiffer``` ( loaded loops and wires forming the huygens metasurface ) , ```A. Epstein``` (synthesis of passive lossless metasurface) and its analytical methodology of HMSs via the equivalence principle, etc, we find the key is how to design a practical engineering equivalent magnetic impedance surface  together with the electric surface finally constituting the Huygens metamaterials. 

**There are several loaded loop aspects like by vias, by stacking multiple PCBs, by capacitive coupling, etc. But for now, no one is without drawbacks. So on the one hand I attempt to review the current trends in HMS fields, on the other hand I also have been doing the some works designing the novel huygens sources and developing the alternative methodology.**

I am currently working on the regulation of electromagnetic waves using boundary conditions of surface discontinuities and analytical generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) for the discontinuties in electromagnetic fields.


$$ E\_{t+}-E\_{t-}=\left(j\\omega\mu d \overline{I}\_{t}-\dfrac {d}{j\omega \varepsilon} \nabla\_{t} \nabla\_{t} \right) \cdot n \times H\_{t-}$$


$$n \times H\_{t+}-n \times H\_{t-}=j\omega \mu d E\_{t-}+\dfrac {d}{j\\omega\mu}\nabla\_{t} \times \left(\nabla\_{t} \times E\_{t+}\right)$$
